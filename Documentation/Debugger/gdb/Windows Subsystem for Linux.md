# Windows 10's Windows Subsystem for Linux

With the release of Windows 10 Creators Update (Build 15063), you will now be able to use Visual Studio Code and the Microsoft C/C++ extension to debug your [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) projects.

Code can be written on Windows itself using VSCode and debugged through `bash.exe` to the Bash on Windows layer.

As of the Fall Creator's Update, you can have multiple distros installed, but `bash.exe` and `wsl.exe` use the default distro. Use [WSL Config](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/wsl-config) to set your default distro.

**NOTE: Creator's Update (Build 15063 or later) is required due to bug-fixes within the subsystem that we rely on to provide debugging. Debugging using a previous version of WSL is unsupported and likely will not work. To check your Windows version, enter `winver` in a command prompt.**

## Prerequisites

* [Windows 10 Creators Update or later with Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) installed.
* Install g++/gcc and gdb within `WSL` to allow compiling and debugging. You can use the package manager to do this. For example, to install g++, you can run `sudo apt install g++` in the Bash window.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) + Microsoft C/C++ extension for VSCode.

## How-To

To debug, commands will be routed from Windows through `bash.exe` to set up debugging. Because our extension runs as a 32-bit process, it will need to use the `C:\Windows\SysNative` folder to access the `bash.exe` executable that is normally in `C:\Windows\System32`. We will be using the `"pipeTransport"` ability within the extension to do debugging and `"sourceFileMap"` to map the source from the subsystem's paths back to Windows path.

**NOTE: Applications will need to be compiled in the `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)` prior to debugging.**

### Example `launch.json` for Launching

In the following example, I have a local drive, `Z:\` that has my source code within windows for an app called _kitchensink_. I have set up the `"program"` and `"cwd"` paths to point to the directory within `WSL`. I have set up the `"pipeTransport"` to use `bash.exe`. I have also set up a `"sourceFileMap"` to have everything that is returned by `gdb` that starts with `/mnt/z` to point to `Z:\\` in Windows.

```json
{
    "name": "C++ Launch",
    "type": "cppdbg",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "/mnt/z/Bash/kitchensink/a.out",
    "args": ["-fThreading"],
    "stopAtEntry": false,
    "cwd": "/mnt/z/Bash/kitchensink",
    "environment": [],
    "externalConsole": true,
    "windows": {
        "MIMode": "gdb",
        "setupCommands": [
            {
                "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                "ignoreFailures": true
            }
        ]
    },
    "pipeTransport": {
        "pipeCwd": "",
        "pipeProgram": "c:\\windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe",
        "pipeArgs": ["-c"],
        "debuggerPath": "/usr/bin/gdb"
    },
    "sourceFileMap": {
        "/mnt/z": "z:\\"
    }
}
```

### Example `launch.json` for Attaching to an Existing Process

This configuration similar to the launch process above. I have chosen to start the same application above from the Bash command line and now I want to attach to it for debugging. I have changed the `"processID"` to use the remote process picker by specifying the command `"${command:pickRemoteProcess}"` and set up the same `"sourceFileMap"`. When I press <kbd>F5</kbd> to attach, I get a picker drop down showing the running processes within `WSL`. I can scroll or search for the process I want to attach to and start debugging.

```json
{
    "name": "C++ Attach",
    "type": "cppdbg",
    "request": "attach",
    "program": "/mnt/z/Bash/kitchensink/a.out",
    "processId": "${command:pickRemoteProcess}",
    "windows": {
        "MIMode": "gdb",
        "setupCommands": [
            {
                "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                "ignoreFailures": true
            }
        ]
    },
    "pipeTransport": {
        "pipeCwd": "",
        "pipeProgram": "c:\\windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe",
        "pipeArgs": ["-c"],
        "debuggerPath": "/usr/bin/gdb"
    },
    "sourceFileMap": {
        "/mnt/z": "z:\\"
    }
}
```
